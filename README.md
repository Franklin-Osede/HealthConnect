HealthConnect is a comprehensive healthcare management system designed to streamline patient care by integrating various microservices. Built using Rust and the Actix Web framework, it ensures high performance and safety. The system includes services for authentication, patient management, appointment scheduling, and facial verification to prevent identity fraud.

Features

Authentication Service: Manages user registration and login with JWT-based authentication.
Patient Management Service: Handles patient records, including medical history and personal information.
Appointment Scheduling Service: Facilitates booking, rescheduling, and canceling medical appointments.
Facial Verification Service: Enhances security by implementing facial recognition during authentication to prevent identity theft.
Architecture
HealthConnect adopts a microservices architecture, with each service operating independently and communicating over HTTP. The primary components include:

API Gateway: Routes client requests to the appropriate microservice.
Authentication Service: Manages user credentials and issues JWTs.
Patient Management Service: Maintains patient data and medical histories.
Appointment Scheduling Service: Oversees appointment logistics.
Facial Verification Service: Processes and verifies facial data to confirm user identities.
Each microservice is developed using Rust and the Actix Web framework, ensuring asynchronous, high-performance operations. PostgreSQL serves as the primary database, and Docker is used for containerization. Continuous integration and deployment are managed with GitHub Actions, and Kubernetes orchestrates the deployment.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Before setting up HealthConnect, ensure you have the following installed:

Rust (version 1.72 or later)
Docker
Docker Compose
PostgreSQL
Git
Installation
Clone the Repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HealthConnect.git
cd HealthConnect
Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory and define the necessary environment variables:


DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost/healthconnect
Replace username and password with your PostgreSQL credentials.

Build and Run Services with Docker Compose:

docker-compose up --build
This command builds and starts all microservices defined in the docker-compose.yaml file.

Running the Services
Each microservice can be run individually for development purposes:

Navigate to the Service Directory:

cd services/authentication
Run the Service:

cargo run
Ensure that the required environment variables are set before running the service.

Usage
After starting the services, you can interact with the API using tools like Postman or cURL.
